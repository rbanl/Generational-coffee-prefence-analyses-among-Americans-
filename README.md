#Generational coffee prefence analysis among Americans  

My analysis involved analysing the preference of features in coffee such as roast level and flavour, in an american population containing multiple generations. The analysis answered 3 questinos primarily:

1. What roast level do Americans prefer? 
2. Do they show a preferences for certain flavours ? 
3. What is the most popular coffee?

My analysis was done in Excel,  and used the chi-squared test to confirm and pivot tables for subsequent analysis of preference frequency. Results were displayed in a dashboard.
